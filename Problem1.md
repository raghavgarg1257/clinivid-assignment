# Problem 1 (Theoretical)

### Question

**A.** Given that you have only 32MB of RAM available and the average profile image size is
100KB, therefore all the images can not fit in the RAM. What is the best way you can
think of to store these images on the hard disk drive? (Assume that unlike RAM, hard
drive has no space limitation).

**B.** Suppose each image has the same name as the person id, i.e., if person id is 23321123
the name of the profile image will be 23321123.jpg. What is the best way to get this
image from the hard disk? Assume ids and image names are unique and ids are 8-digit
numbers, and the platform takes 4 byte to store the integers.
